# Hi! I'm maulana!
- I'm a **12 year old kid** who can already program `HTML, CSS and JS` (_only a little I can, maybe I use AI to code_)
- I started learning `HTML, CSS and JS` in **2021** and using __AI more to make things I want__
- ***I am from ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©***
  
> [!WARNING]
> I'm in *6th grade at elementary school*, so <ins>there are no lessons about programming</ins>, I'm studying *web programming for myself*

  + As for design, **I can't** because <ins>*I'm really bad at CSS*, and as for making *websites functional and lively*</ins>, I probably **still can**
